# Tenderly Virtual TestNets CI/CD Infrastructure

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Tenderly/vnet-github-action.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Tenderly/vnet-github-action/releases/latest)
[![GitHub marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/marketplace-tenderly--virtual--testnet-blue?logo=github&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/tenderly-virtual-testnet-setup)

The `Tenderly/vnet-github-action` automates provisioning of [Virtual TestNets](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets) for smart contract CI/CD pipelines. Virtual TestNets are testing and staging infrastructure with built [Mainnet State Sync](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/state-sync), [Unlimited Faucet](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/unlimited-faucet), [Debugger](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger), and [Public Block Explorer](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/testnet-explorer)

This action creates a new Virtual TestNet from your configuration and exposes its RPC URLs through environment variables, enabling automated testing and staging environments for your protocols.

This action enables:

- **Continuous Integration with Hardhat**: Run your Hardhat tests against a forked network and use Tenderly debugger and Simulator to fix issues
- **Protocol Staging with Hardhat and Foundry**: Deploy and stage your protocols in an isolated, mainnet-like environment
- **Contract Staging with Hardhat and Foundry**: Use dedicated Virtual TestNets as staging environments for contract development

## Quick Start

This example shows how to fork Ethereum mainnet with a custom chain ID, enable the Public Block Explorer, and keep the testnet state in sync with mainnet.

After the step `Setup Virtual TestNet` you can access the RPC URL from `TENDERLY_TESTNET_ID`, `TENDERLY_ADMIN_RPC_URL`, and `TENDERLY_FOUNDRY_VERIFICATION_URL`.

### Step 1: Get Access key and project name

1. Get your [Tenderly access key](https://docs.tenderly.co/account/projects/how-to-generate-api-access-token) and place it in Github Action Secrets under **`TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY`**.
2. Place the [project name and account name](https://docs.tenderly.co/account/projects/account-project-slug) in Github Action environment variables under **`TENDERLY_PROJECT_NAME`** and **`TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_NAME`** respectively.
3. Create the file `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` and use the starter action configuration below.
4. Commit, push, and check your action execution.


```yaml
name: Smart Contract CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Virtual TestNet
        uses: Tenderly/vnet-github-action@v1.0.x
        with:
          mode: CI
          access_key: ${{ secrets.TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY }}
          project_name: ${{ vars.TENDERLY_PROJECT_NAME }}
          account_name: ${{ vars.TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_NAME }}
          testnet_name: 'CI Test Network'
          network_id: 1
          chain_id: 73571  # Recommended: prefix with 7357 for unique identification to avoid transaction replay attacks
          public_explorer: true 
          verification_visibility: 'src'  # Options: 'abi', 'src', 'bytecode'
          state_sync: true 
```

## Integration Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to integrate Tenderly Virtual TestNet into your CI/CD pipeline using popular development frameworks. Each example includes both testing and staging deployment stages, with tests running on ephemeral environments and deployments targeting a persistent staging testnet.

### Hardhat Pipeline

This sample configuration will:
- `test` contracts by deploying them and sending test transactions to an ephemeral Virtual TestNet
- `deploy` contracts to the staging Virtual TestNet

1. Set up your github action using the following starter yaml:

```yaml
name: Hardhat Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Setup Virtual TestNet
        uses: Tenderly/vnet-github-action@v1.0.x
        with:
          access_key: ${{ secrets.TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY }}
          project_name: ${{ vars.TENDERLY_PROJECT_NAME }}
          account_name: ${{ vars.TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_NAME }}
          network_id: 1
          chain_id: 73571
          public_explorer: true
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npx hardhat test --network tenderly_ci

  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Virtual TestNet
        uses: Tenderly/vnet-github-action@v1.0.x
        with:
          access_key: ${{ secrets.TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY }}
          project_name: ${{ vars.TENDERLY_PROJECT_NAME }}
          account_name: ${{ vars.TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_NAME }}
          network_id: 1
          chain_id: 73571
          public_explorer: true
          
      - name: Deploy Contracts
        run: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network tenderly_ci
```

1. Extend your `hardhat.config.js` by adding the following configuration, using the `TENDERLY_ADMIN_RPC_URL` and `TENDERLY_CHAIN_ID`:
   
```javascript
{
  networks: {
   tenderly_ci: {
     url: process.env.TENDERLY_ADMIN_RPC_URL,
     chainId: parseInt(process.env.TENDERLY_CHAIN_ID)
   }
 },
 tenderly: {
   project: process.env.TENDERLY_PROJECT_NAME,
   username: process.env.TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_NAME,
   accessKey: process.env.TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY
 }
}
```

### Foundry Pipeline

This pipeline runs tests and deploys verified contracts to a Virtual TestNet. Virtual TestNets provide a persistent environment, making them ideal for staging and integration testing.

```yaml
name: Foundry Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive
      
      - name: Install Foundry
        uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1
      
      - name: Build and Test
        run: |
          forge build
          forge test -vvv

  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Virtual TestNet
        uses: Tenderly/vnet-github-action@v1.0.x
        with:
          access_key: ${{ secrets.TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY }}
          project_name: ${{ vars.TENDERLY_PROJECT_NAME }}
          account_name: ${{ vars.TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_NAME }}
          network_id: 1
          chain_id: 73571
          public_explorer: true

      - name: Install Foundry
        uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1
      
      - name: Foundry Build
        run: |
          forge --version
          forge build --sizes
          
      - name: Deploy Contracts
        env:
          FOUNDRY_ETH_RPC_URL: ${{ env.TENDERLY_PUBLIC_RPC_URL }}
          FOUNDRY_VERIFIER_URL: ${{ env.TENDERLY_FOUNDRY_VERIFICATION_URL }}
        run: |
          forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
            --rpc-url $FOUNDRY_ETH_RPC_URL \
            --verifier-url $FOUNDRY_VERIFIER_URL \
            --slow \
            --broadcast \
            --verify
```

## Additional notes on Foundry Pipeline

If you'd like to use specific address for the deployment and verification of contracts on Virtual TestNets you can do so by following these steps:

1. Add your private key to GitHub Secrets (through UI or CLI)
2. Update your workflow to include wallet funding and deployment:

```yaml
      - name: Fund Wallet
        run: |
          curl --location ${{ env.TENDERLY_ADMIN_RPC_URL }} \
          --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          --data '{
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "method": "tenderly_setBalance",
            "params": ["${{ secrets.WALLET_ADDRESS }}", "0xDE0B6B3A7640000"],
            "id": "1234"
          }'

      - name: Deploy Contracts
        env:
          FOUNDRY_ETH_RPC_URL: ${{ env.TENDERLY_PUBLIC_RPC_URL }}
          FOUNDRY_VERIFIER_URL: ${{ env.TENDERLY_FOUNDRY_VERIFICATION_URL }}
          PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}
          TENDERLY_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY }}
        run: |
          forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
            --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
            --rpc-url $FOUNDRY_ETH_RPC_URL \
            --verifier-url $FOUNDRY_VERIFIER_URL \
            --etherscan-api-key $TENDERLY_ACCESS_TOKEN \
            --slow \
            --broadcast \
            --verify
```

## Advanced Configuration

Advanced configuration examples demonstrate how to extend the basic Virtual TestNet setup for more complex scenarios, such as multi-network testing and custom chain configurations.

### Multi-Network Testing
Use matrix strategy to test your contracts across multiple networks in parallel. This is particularly useful for protocols that deploy across multiple chains and need to ensure consistent behavior.

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        network: ['1', '137', '42161']  # Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum
    steps:
      - uses: Tenderly/vnet-github-action@v1.0.x
        with:
          network_id: ${{ matrix.network }}
          chain_id: ${{ format('7357{0}', matrix.network) }}
```

## Debugging

Enable debug logs by setting:
```yaml
env:
  DEBUG: '@tenderly/github-action'
```

## Notes

* Virtual TestNets are automatically cleaned up after the workflow completes
* Use matrix builds for testing across multiple networks
* Contract verification works automatically. Follow the guides for verification with [Hardhat](https://docs.tenderly.co/contract-verification/hardhat) and [Foundry](https://docs.tenderly.co/contract-verification/foundry).
* Use unique chain IDs when possible (e.g. by prefixing with `7357`) to avoid transaction replay attacks.
* If you don't want to use Github UI to add required variables, you can do the following with utilizing Github CLI. Commands that enable you do it are:
```bash
TENDERLY_PROJECT_NAME=...
TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_NAME=...
TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY=...
gh variable set TENDERLY_PROJECT_NAME --body ${TENDERLY_PROJECT_NAME}
gh variable set TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_NAME --body ${TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_NAME}
gh secret set TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY --body ${TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY}
```
